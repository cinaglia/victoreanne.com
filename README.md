# [Victor & Anne](http://victoreanne.com)

This is the source-code of my wedding website, http://victoreanne.com.

A responsive SPA (Single-page application) built in mid-2012 with the purpose of allowing our family and friends in Brazil to gather information about our wedding day, leave comments, as well as to know a bit more about our relationship.

It features a straight-forward [RSVP](src/rsvp.php) mechanism written in PHP (and AJAX) that essentially sends us an e-mail whenever someone RSVPs. The script does not implement any CSRF or abuse protection as it was tailored to our circle of friends.
